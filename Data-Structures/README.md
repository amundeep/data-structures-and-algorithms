# Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a list of nodes that contain references to the next node in the list.  Each node also has its own value associated with it.

## Challenge
The challenge was to create a LinkedList and Node class and relevant functions for each

## Approach & Efficiency
I followed a similar approach to the last class where we continually created test methods to ensure the class functionality is working as intended.  Creating tests first helped a lot with how I wanted the class structure to look.

## API
LinkedList:
insert(value): inserts a new node with value at the head of the linked list
includes(value): finds a node in the linked list that has the specified value, returns True/False
__str__: The string representation of the linked list.
